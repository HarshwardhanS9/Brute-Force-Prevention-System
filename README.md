# Brute Force Prevention System

This project is a basic implementation of a brute-force prevention system, designed to enhance login security by restricting excessive failed login attempts.

## üåê Live Demo

> _Coming Soon_

## üß∞ Features

- Basic login interface (HTML)
- Designed to extend into a full brute-force protection mechanism
- Placeholder for features like rate limiting, CAPTCHA, and account lockout

## üõ†Ô∏è Planned Enhancements

- Implement server-side rate limiting
- Add CAPTCHA after multiple failed attempts
- Store failed login attempts by IP and username
- Add user feedback for blocked login attempts
- Support for multi-factor authentication (MFA)

## üöÄ Getting Started

To run this project locally:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/HarshwardhanS9/Brute-force-prevention-system.git
   ```

2. Open `index.html` in your web browser.

> **Note**: This project is currently front-end only. Back-end implementation (Node.js, Python Flask/Django, etc.) will be needed to enforce brute-force protection.

## üõ°Ô∏è What is Brute Force Protection?

Brute-force attacks are a type of cyberattack where an attacker systematically tries a large number of possible passwords or keys to gain unauthorized access to a system. 

Effective brute-force protection mechanisms include:

- **Rate Limiting**: Limit the number of login attempts from a single user or IP.
- **Account Lockouts**: Temporarily disable accounts after a number of failed attempts.
- **CAPTCHA Integration**: Ensure that login attempts are performed by humans.
- **IP Blocking**: Block or blacklist IPs that show suspicious behavior.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Require a second form of verification.

These measures help to safeguard user accounts and sensitive data from unauthorized access.
